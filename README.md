# PackingList_creator_1750

Project is to create a web application to allow users to select items from a database and create  DD Form 1750 with as little inconvience as possible. The plan is to use python and html/css to create a web interface for ease of use. Reason for this is to simplify the process of creating 1750's and to also make the process faster than having to manually write it or even having to type it out.
